    ; Prepare to execute `lspci -vmm`
    ; To execute a command in a real scenario, you need to fork a process,
    ; use execve to replace the process image with the command,
    ; and potentially redirect output using pipes.

    ; Example placeholder for command execution setup
    ; This is a demonstration setup, as direct command execution is complex in assembly
    ; Requires setting up environment and parameters properly.

    ; Example: mov rax, 59 (sys_execve), etc.
    ; Here we assume you've set up the command in buffer for the purpose of demonstration.

    ; Read the output of the lspci command (dummy implementation)
    ; Here, simulate a buffer being filled with GPU info
    mov rax, 0              ; syscall number for sys_read
    mov rdi, 0              ; file descriptor (stdin, in a real scenario would be pipe)
    lea rsi, [buffer]       ; buffer to store output
    mov rdx, 1024           ; maximum number of bytes to read
    syscall
